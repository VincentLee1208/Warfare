## Warfare

*Warefare* is a strategic tile game where the player must place multiple types of units 
into a grid and control their movements in order to defeat the enemy.  The player will 
have to carefully consider between battling enemies to earn money for more units while 
trying to keep as many of their own alive as they progress through the levels.

*Warefare* will include:
- Grid play area where that multiple types of units with different attributes can be placed on
- A basic AI system for the enemy units to follow when battling against the player
- A buy phase with a money system that allows the player to buy more units before entering the battle
- A prep phase that players can use to place down their units in any configuration they choose to defeat the enemy's units
- A battle phase where each unit on the board gets to perform actions that will impact the outcome of the battle

I have always been a huge fan of playing games but didn't have much experience when it comes to creating them.
I believe that the structure behind *Warfare* will be a good entry for me to understand more of what it takes to
create a full game and could possibly be expanded into something even larger in the future.
